## VRPSolver model for the Multi-Depot Open Vehicle Routing Problem (MDOVRP)

This respositry the VRPPSolver model and the instances proposed in the paper "On the exact solution of the multi-depot open vehicle routing problem". That model can be used to solve instances of Multi-Depot Open Vehicle Routing Problem (MDOVRP), Multi-Depot Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MDOVRPTW), Open Vehicle Routing Problem (OVRP) and Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (OVRPTW).
